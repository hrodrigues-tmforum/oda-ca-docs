 [![Documentation Process](https://img.youtube.com/vi/C_1WW0o0Z5o/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_1WW0o0Z5o)


The published home of the documentation is [https://tmforum-oda.github.io/oda-ca-docs/](https://tmforum-oda.github.io/oda-ca-docs/)

The documentation is published as GitHub pages from the [/docs](https://github.com/tmforum-oda/oda-ca-docs/tree/master/docs) folder. The documentation content is maintained as README and other content files in each of the TM Forum ODA repositories. The structure to the documentation uses the Sphinx framework (https://www.sphinx-doc.org/). The structure is maintained in the [/sphinx_documentation](https://github.com/tmforum-oda/oda-ca-docs/tree/master/sphinx_documentation) folder. Within this folder there is a `buildClean.bat` file that will re-build the documentation from the source.

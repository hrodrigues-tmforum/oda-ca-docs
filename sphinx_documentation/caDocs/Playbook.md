# Introduction to the ODA-CA

**Step 1: Learn about Open Digital Architecture**

ODA is a blueprint for modular, cloud-based, open digital platforms that can be orchestrated using AI - start with the webpage [here](https://www.tmforum.org/oda/).

**Step 2: Commit to ODA's design principles and essential standards to enable a truly ‘plug and play’ set of technology capabilities**

Check your company has signed the [ODA manifesto](https://www.tmforum.org/oda/open-digital-architecture-open-api-manifesto/)

**Step 3: Join the ODA Project to view additional ODA documents**

[Join here](https://engage.tmforum.org/projects/volunteer-opportunity-details?VolunteerOpportunityKey=603731cf-09c5-4229-8730-c900c157c07b&CommunityKey=0430eebd-2dac-41b6-bd1b-fba7ebcfe7d7&_ga=2.154545981.400866836.1614620569-367684471.1602091309) (joining the Core Project provides access to 5 collaboration projects in one go, including ODA)

**Step 4: Check that your company has joined the ODA-CA project**
 
Request access to the [ODA-CA Confluence space](https://projects.tmforum.org/wiki/x/sk64C) and other resources ([Sue Davis](https://projects.tmforum.org/wiki/display/~sdavis@tmforum.org) can help with this).  If you have already received credentials to join Git and Slack for this project you can skip this step.

**Step 5: Read an overview of the ODA-CA Project**

Check out the [ODA-CA briefing presentation here](https://projects.tmforum.org/wiki/x/jY6UCQ)

**Step 6: Watch the 'Show & Tell' videos from the end of each sprint**

* Sprint 1: [video recording](https://video.ibm.com/channel/24077591/video/lf09c2) and [notes including presentations](https://projects.tmforum.org/wiki/x/bfowCQ). Covers the Open Digital Lab environment and an initial proof-of-concept for automated ODA compliance validation of ‘black box’ and ‘glass box’ commercial products.

* Sprint 2: [video recording](https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/J3JyQ4q7ZpBGtoG2MOdlM9hYAKrVXdis09rmzoPcEnopvUy4S3-yCphydlpYDx8K.Je5BAFFXOLUmrqEo) and [notes including presentations](https://projects.tmforum.org/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=168397244&preview=%2F168397244%2F168397695%2F2021.04.06+ODA-CA+Show+%26+Tell.pdf). Covers Security Validation of ODA Components, an API Operator for Whale Cloud API Gateway and Oracle Proxy Components. Includes proposed roadmap for next sprints.



**Step 7: Watch the Sprint 2 demo of Security Validation (Mar 2021)**

The [demo here](https://projects.tmforum.org/wiki/x/oqu2CQ) explains the concepts of security / party role validation for ODA components

**Step 8: View the inventory of ODA components to help the design and implementation of solutions that meet the architectural design requirements of ODA**

[IG1242 ODA Component Inventory & Heatmap v1.0.0](https://projects.tmforum.org/wiki/x/-SC4C)

**Step 9: Complete the Component Audit**

Map your company's applications to the ODA Component inventory - find out more [here](https://projects.tmforum.org/wiki/x/I6kwCQ)

**Step 10: Log into [GitHub](https://github.com/tmforum-oda) using the credentials sent to you by IT Support when you joined the project.**

Browse around to find documentation and demonstrations: eg [here](ODAComponentDesignGuidelines.md) is our Component Design guide with instructions on how to create a component, and [here](ContributionsGuide.md) is the process for making contributions.

**Step 11: Ask questions on [Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T01C5A3NAU9/C01CGGDDLCQ)**

The team will be happy to help get you started.

**Step 12: On-board your own candidate components into the Open Digital Lab**

[Request a call](mailto:sdavis@tmforum.org) if you want help - [Sue Davis](https://projects.tmforum.org/wiki/display/~sdavis@tmforum.org) will get you connected to the right people and resources.
